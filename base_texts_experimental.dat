# Simutranslator settings for Simutrans-Experimental texts
# Author: jamespetts
# Created: June 2009
# 
# Note: Simutranslator will merge the default texts for Simutrans-Standard 
# with the translated texts that are specific to Simutrans-Experimental. 
# Therefore, to get the optimum texts for Simutrans-Experimental in English
# (with texts from Simutrans-Standard changed appropraitely), use the supplied
# en.tab, and not the en.tab from Simutranslator. Use Simutranslator for non-English
# languages.
